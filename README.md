This project is a **Game of Thrones conversational AI chatbot** powered by:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **ChromaDB vector embeddings**
- **Local sentence-transformer embeddings**
- **OpenAI GPT for response generation**
- **Selectable character voices (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Arya, Daenerys, Cersei, Raven)**
- **Dark-theme, avatar-based Streamlit UI**

The chatbot answers **strictly using the Game of Thrones lore PDF you provide** and rejects out-of-universe questions.
